UVOTPY Streak Read Out (Saturated) Photometry Instructions
	1. Download the data
	2. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder with the downloaded data
	3. Unzip the data by typing “gunzip */uvot/image/*.gz”
	4. Open python by typing “python --pylab” into the terminal
	5. Import the package with “from uvotpy import readout_streak”
	6. Run the photometry code portion with:
		a. name = 'SN2023ixf'
		b. ra,dec = 210.910653712, +54.311674484
		c. obsid = "00032481016"
		d. indir = "./00032481016/uvot/image"
		e. readout_streak.photometry(obsid, target=name, datadir=indir, radec=[ra,dec], outfile='SN2023ixf_streak_photometry', interactive=True, use_python_only=True)
			i. Had to change “import ros” to “from uvotpy import ros” in “readout_streak.py” on line 334 AND you have to exit python –pylab and restart python –pylab
			ii. Make sure you have updated GitHub version of “readout_streak.py”
