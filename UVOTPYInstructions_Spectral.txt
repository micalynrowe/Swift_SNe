Processing the Data With UVOTPY
	1. Get data downloaded
	2. Open your terminal (and navigate into folder where you put the data)
	3. Initiate ipython with “ipython --pylab”
	4. Get coordinates for SN by typing “tns __SNName__” into google
	5. Copy the RA/Dec to your clipboard
	6. In ipython type: and then hit enter
		a. from uvotpy import uvotgetspec
		b. ra,dec = ___ , ___ (paste stuff from clipboard and add a comma)
		c. obsid = “_first11digits_”
		d. ext = 1
		e. datadir = “_targetid_/uvot/image”
		f. uvotgetspec.getSpec(ra,dec,obsid,ext,indir=datadir,fit_second=True,chatter=1)
	7. You will get 3 figures of spectra spit out
	8. Then in ipython type: and then hit enter
		a. phafiles = ['sw_targetid_ugu_1ord_1_g.pha', 'sw_targetid_ugu_1ord_2_g.pha',…_all the pha files for that target id_]
		b. uvotspec.sum_PHAspectra(phafiles,outfile='sum__targetid_.fits',wave_shifts=[0,0],objectname='_SNName_',chatter=5,ignore_flags=True)
	9. Exit out of ipython by typing “exit”
	10. Convert one extensions’ PHA file to something we can plot by typing this into the terminal and then hitting enter
		a. ftlist sw_targetid_ugu_1ord_1_g.pha+2 columns=lambda,flux,fluxerr rownum=no colheader=no outfile=_targetid_e1spectrum.txt clobber=yes option=T
	11. Convert summed fits spectra to something we can plot by typing this into the terminal and then hitting enter
		a. ftlist sum__targetid_.fits columns=wave,flux,fluxerr rownum=no colheader=no outfile=_targetid_sumspectrum.txt clobber=yes option=T
	12. Then you can plot in Jupyter Notebook



Definitions
Sequence | Vers | Object | Observed | Processed | Comment
Sequence – first 8 digits are the ‘target id’ (a specific coordinate is associated with it) and adding the last 3 digits is the ‘obs id’ (these are sequentially added)
Vers – first time it appears on Quicklook site (like new data)
Object – comes from observing plan sent to archive

Log.uir | Exp ID | ICU.label | Mode | Submode | Filter | Event Window
Exp ID – based on time started
ICU.label – what was used

ImageWindow | Binning | Duration | Count Rate | Image Dataloss | Good Attitude Fraction | Completion

Aux = auxillary files from spacecraft
Bat = burst alert telescope
Log = various observing logs (gives you the uir{uvot instrument report})
Uvot = data from uvot
Xrt = xray telescope

.ex = exposure map coordinates
.rw = raw exposure CCD coordinates
.sk = sky image (what we use), instrument pointing information, uses stars to improve astrometric calibration

AT = Astrophysical Transient
ANON = template observation
